//! Common Types for Debugging Functionality
//!
//! This module defines the core data structures used throughout the debug system:
//!
//! - [`ProcessInfo`] - Basic information about a running process
//! - [`DebugEvent`] - Events received from the debugger (breakpoints, exceptions, etc.)
//! - [`DebugState`] - Current state of the debugging session
//! - [`RegisterState`] - CPU register values (x86-64)
//! - [`Breakpoint`] - Software breakpoint representation
//!
//! These types are platform-agnostic and used by all debugger implementations.
